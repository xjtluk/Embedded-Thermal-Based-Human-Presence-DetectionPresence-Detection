# **Embedded Thermal-Based Human Presence Detection**

KE BAI , [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yourusername/thermal-presence), [Edge Impulse Project](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/studio/679618)

## **Introduction**
This project implements a **real-time human-presence detector** using an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense paired with a 32×24 MLX90640 thermal imager. It continuously samples thermal frames at 4 Hz, preprocesses them as time-series data, and runs inference on a TinyML classification model exported from Edge Impulse to light the onboard LED and trigger a buzzer when a person is detected. This approach leverages the robustness of infrared sensing—unaffected by lighting or privacy concerns—with on-device ML to create a handheld, privacy‐preserving presence detector.

The inspiration came from low-resolution thermal person-detection research with the MLX90640, which has been shown to achieve over 97% single-person accuracy when paired with lightweight neural networks. Existing tutorials on TinyML Edge Impulse workflows guided the CSV Wizard and Time Series setup used in this implementation.

## **Research Question**
**Can a Nano 33 BLE Sense running a TinyML time-series classifier on MLX90640 thermal data reliably detect human presence in real time on-device?**

## **Application Overview**
The system comprises three core blocks:

1. **Sensor Acquisition**: MLX90640 captures 768-value thermal frames at 4 Hz via I²C using Adafruit's library.

2. **Edge Impulse TinyML Pipeline**: CSV Wizard ingests raw thermal arrays as time-series. Impulse Design uses a "Raw data" input, normalization block, and a Keras classifier.

3. **On-Device Inference & Actuation**: Arduino code builds a `signal_t` from each frame, calls `run_classifier()`, and applies a 1-s majority vote over four frames to update the built-in LED and buzzer.

This modular design ensures data consistency from collection through deployment and provides clear separation between sensing, ML, and hardware control components.

## **Data**
**Sources**: Thermal frames logged from MLX90640 across multiple scenarios—standing, sitting, walking, and empty room—totaling ~500 frames.

**Cleaning & Organization**:
- Python scripts read serial output CSVs (768 columns) and filter non-numeric lines.
- Frames were visualized with Matplotlib (`inferno` colormap) to verify correct thermal signatures and manual label accuracy.
- Directory structure:
  ```
  dataset/
    person/
      data_person.csv
    empty/
      data_empty.csv
  ```
- CSV Wizard was configured with a 250 ms sampling interval, no timestamps, no zero-padding, ensuring each row represents one frame sample.

## **Model**
A **Keras sequential classifier** was chosen for its balance of expressiveness and on-device footprint. The architecture comprises:
- **Input**: 768 raw temperature features (24×32 flattened).
- **Dense layers**: Two hidden layers (128 → 64 units) with ReLU activations.
- **Output**: Softmax over 2 classes ("person", "empty").

Alternative experiments with **Decision Tree** models were conducted to compare RAM usage; however, the neural network delivered higher accuracy with quantized (int8) weights, running in ~8 ms per inference. A diagram of the dense network is shown below:

```
[768] → Dense(128, ReLU) → Dense(64, ReLU) → Dense(2, Softmax)
```

## **Experiments**
1. **Architecture Sweep**: Tested single vs. dual hidden layers (units = [64,128])—tracked accuracy and on-device latency.

2. **Quantization**: Compared float32 vs. int8 quantized models; int8 reduced RAM by 30% with <1% accuracy drop.

3. **Window Size Variation**: Evaluated overlapping windows (250 ms stride) vs. non-overlap—little accuracy gain, chose non-overlap for simplicity.

4. **Voting Window**: Varied vote length (3–6 frames) to trade off latency vs. stability, selected 4‐frame (1 s) window.

Performance was measured using Edge Impulse's **On-device performance** estimator and Arduino serial logs for end-to-end inference timing. Accuracy graphs (per-class precision/recall) and latency histograms were generated in Python with Matplotlib.

## **Results and Observations**
- **Overall Accuracy**: 83% on held-out test set, consistent with development estimates.
- **Latency**: Mean 8 ms per inference on Nano 33 BLE Sense, allowing >100 Hz theoretical throughput; constrained by sensor to 4 Hz.
- **Stability**: 1 s voting reduced flicker; direct per-frame decisions were too noisy due to sensor quantization.
- **Limitations**:
  - Low resolution occasionally misclassified small thermal signatures (e.g., seated person far away).
  - Background temperature drift required calibration or background subtraction in future work.
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Incorporate **background subtraction** to highlight dynamic heat sources.
  - Collect more varied data (different rooms, more subjects) to improve generalization.
  - Evaluate lightweight CNN pruning and knowledge distillation for even faster inference.
