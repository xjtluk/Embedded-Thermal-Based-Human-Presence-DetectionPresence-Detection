## **Introduction**
This project implements a **real-time human-presence detector** using an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense paired with a 32×24 MLX90640 thermal imager. It continuously samples thermal frames at 4 Hz, preprocesses them as time-series data, and runs inference on a TinyML classification model exported from Edge Impulse to light the onboard LED and trigger a buzzer when a person is detected. This approach leverages the robustness of infrared sensing—unaffected by lighting or privacy concerns—with on-device ML to create a handheld, privacy‐preserving presence detector.

The inspiration came from low-resolution thermal person-detection research with the MLX90640, which has been shown to achieve over 97% single-person accuracy when paired with lightweight neural networks. Thermal sensing offers distinct advantages over conventional camera-based solutions: it works reliably in complete darkness, preserves privacy by not capturing identifiable features, and can detect heat signatures through thin barriers.

The MLX90640 was specifically chosen for its balance of resolution (32×24 pixels) and affordability, providing sufficient thermal detail while keeping costs reasonable. This sensor, along with the Nano 33 BLE Sense's powerful Cortex-M4F processor, creates an ideal platform for edge AI applications where power consumption and form factor are critical considerations.

The hardware enclosure was designed for portability with accessible controls, housing all components in a compact form factor that protects the sensitive thermal sensor while allowing it an unobstructed field of view.

## **Research Question**
**Can a Nano 33 BLE Sense running a TinyML time-series classifier on MLX90640 thermal data reliably detect human presence in real time on-device with minimal false positives in varied environmental conditions?**

## **Application Overview**
The system architecture consists of three integrated functional blocks:

1. **Sensor Acquisition**: The MLX90640 thermal camera connects to the Nano 33 BLE Sense via I²C, operating at 400kHz. Raw thermal frames (768 values representing temperatures) are captured at 4 Hz using Adafruit's MLX90640 library. Each frame undergoes preliminary filtering to remove potential noise and artifacts before being processed. The sensor's configuration (chess pattern mode, 18-bit ADC resolution) was selected to optimize for both measurement accuracy and sampling rate.

2. **Edge Impulse TinyML Pipeline**: The data processing pipeline begins with CSV Wizard ingesting raw thermal arrays as time-series data. Each sample consists of 768 temperature values, arranged in consecutive frames with 250 ms windows. The preprocessing block applies normalization to account for environmental temperature variations. This normalized data feeds into a Keras classifier optimized for embedded deployment through int8 quantization.

3. **On-Device Inference & Actuation**: The Arduino firmware constructs a `signal_t` from each incoming thermal frame, passes it through the quantized model using `run_classifier()`, and implements a temporal filtering mechanism via a 1-second majority vote (4 frames). This voting mechanism significantly reduces transient false positives. The detection outcome drives both visual feedback (onboard LED) and audio alerts (4kHz buzzer tone), creating a multi-modal notification system.

## **Data**
The dataset consists of thermal frames captured across diverse scenarios that reflect real-world detection challenges:

**Data Collection Process**:
- Systematic thermal sampling in multiple environments (home, office, laboratory)
- Varied subject positions: standing (near/far), sitting, walking, partial occlusions
- Empty room captures with different ambient temperatures (morning/afternoon/evening)
- Total dataset: ~500 frames per class, balanced between "person" and "empty" categories

**Processing Methodology**:
- Custom Python scripts (`collect.py`) streamline serial capture and CSV formatting
- Data cleaning removes non-numeric entries and communication artifacts
- Visualization tools (`image.py`) render thermal frames with the `inferno` colormap to verify thermal signatures
- Directory structure organizes data by class:
  ```
  dataset/
    person/
      data_person.csv  # 768 columns × ~250 rows
    empty/
      data_empty.csv   # 768 columns × ~250 rows
  ```

Quality assurance included manual inspection of randomly sampled frames to verify correct labeling and sensor calibration. The CSV Wizard configuration (250 ms sampling interval, no timestamps) ensures each row represents a complete thermal snapshot, preserving spatial relationships within the 32×24 thermal grid.

## **Model**
Based on systematic experimentation, I selected a **lightweight feedforward neural network** architecture optimized for the Nano 33 BLE Sense's constrained resources. The model implementation consists of:

```python
# model architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(20, activation='relu', 
        activity_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l1(0.00001)))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='relu', 
        activity_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l1(0.00001)))
model.add(Dense(classes, name='y_pred', activation='softmax'))
```

This architecture offers several advantages for this specific application:

- **Compact Input Layer**: Directly processes the flattened 768 temperature values
- **Efficient Hidden Layers**: Two dense layers (20 → 10 neurons) provide sufficient representation power while maintaining minimal parameter count
- **L1 Regularization**: Applied to both hidden layers to prevent overfitting and promote sparsity (critical for int8 quantization efficiency)
- **Softmax Output**: Clear probability distribution between "person" and "empty" classes

Alternative architectures were evaluated, including a larger model (128 → 64 neurons) and a CNN approach that attempted to preserve spatial relationships. The selected smaller architecture demonstrated superior performance considering the accuracy-vs-resource tradeoff, requiring only 15KB of flash memory after quantization while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Comparison testing revealed that larger models offered negligible accuracy improvements (+1.2%) but significantly increased inference time and memory usage. The L1 regularization proved essential in maintaining model generalizability across different environmental conditions.

## **Experiments**
The development process involved systematic experimentation to optimize model performance for embedded deployment:

1. **Neural Network Architecture Optimization**:
   - Tested layer configurations: [20→10], [128→64], [64→32→16]
   - Evaluated activation functions: ReLU vs. LeakyReLU vs. TanH
   - Compared regularization strategies: none vs. L1 vs. L2 vs. dropout
   - Results: The 20→10 architecture with ReLU and L1 regularization provided the best accuracy/size tradeoff
   
   | Architecture | Accuracy | Model Size | Inference Time |
   |--------------|----------|------------|----------------|
   | 20→10 (final)| 85.3%    | 15KB       | 5ms            |
   | 128→64       | 86.5%    | 196KB      | 12ms           |
   | 64→32→16     | 85.9%    | 104KB      | 9ms            |

2. **Quantization Parameter Tuning**:
   - Compared float32 (original) vs. int8 (quantized) models
   - Measured impact on memory footprint and inference speed
   - Results: int8 quantization reduced model size by 75% with only 0.8% accuracy reduction

3. **Temporal Filtering Optimization**:
   - Tested voting window lengths: 2, 4, 6, and 8 frames
   - Evaluated majority threshold variants: >50% vs. ≥75% positive frames
   - Results: 4-frame window with >50% threshold achieved optimal balance between responsiveness and stability

4. **Environmental Adaptability**:
   - Cross-validation across different rooms/lighting conditions
   - Simulation of temperature drifts by varying ambient temperature
   - Results: Model maintained >80% accuracy across test environments

Performance evaluation utilized Edge Impulse's on-device testing framework combined with custom Python scripts for analyzing false positive/negative rates. The final system achieved 85.3% accuracy on the test dataset with 5ms average inference time, allowing significant headroom below the 250ms sampling period.

## **Results and Observations**
The project demonstrated successful implementation of an embedded thermal-based human detection system, with several notable findings:

**Performance Achievements**:
- **Classification Accuracy**: 85.3% on held-out test data
- **Processing Efficiency**: 5ms average inference time per frame on Nano 33 BLE Sense
- **Detection Range**: Reliable detection up to 5 meters in controlled environments
- **Temporal Stability**: 1-second voting window effectively eliminated transient false positives

**Key Challenges**:
- **Resolution Limitations**: The 32×24 thermal grid occasionally misclassified distant or partially visible subjects, particularly when occupying <10% of the field of view
- **Environmental Factors**: Background temperature drift affected detection reliability in spaces with heating/cooling transitions
- **Distance Sensitivity**: Detection confidence deteriorated beyond 5 meters, with accuracy dropping to approximately 70%
- **Fixed Thresholds**: The current implementation uses static decision boundaries, limiting adaptability across diverse environments

**Critical Reflection**:
The project demonstrates that low-resolution thermal imaging combined with optimized TinyML models can deliver effective presence detection with minimal computational resources. The selection of a smaller neural network (20→10) prioritizing resource efficiency over marginal accuracy gains proved to be the correct approach for embedded deployment.

While the system performs well in controlled settings, several avenues for improvement emerged during testing:

1. **Adaptive Thresholding**: Implementing dynamic confidence thresholds based on environmental temperature analysis
2. **Background Subtraction**: Incorporating frame differencing techniques to highlight dynamic heat sources against static backgrounds
3. **Transfer Learning**: Exploring knowledge distillation from larger models to maintain accuracy while reducing parameter count
4. **Dataset Expansion**: Collecting more diverse data representing edge cases (partially occluded subjects, non-human heat sources)
5. **Feature Engineering**: Investigating targeted feature extraction from thermal frames rather than using raw pixel values

Overall, this project demonstrates the viability of privacy-preserving thermal detection for IoT applications, smart buildings, and security systems. Its resource efficiency and non-visual nature make it particularly suitable for deployment in privacy-sensitive environments where conventional camera systems would be inappropriate.
