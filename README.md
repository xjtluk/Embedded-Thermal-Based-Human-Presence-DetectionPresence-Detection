## **Introduction**
This project implements a **real-time human presence detector** using an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense paired with a 32×24 MLX90640 thermal imager. The system continuously samples thermal frames at 4 Hz, processes them through a TinyML classifier, and triggers LED and buzzer alerts when a person is detected.

My inspiration came from the need to create privacy-preserving occupancy sensors for smart buildings that work reliably in all lighting conditions. Thermal sensing offers distinct advantages over camera-based solutions: functioning in complete darkness, preserving privacy by not capturing identifiable features, detecting heat signatures through thin barriers, and performing consistently regardless of ambient light.

This work builds upon Vandersteegen et al.'s research on ultra-low resolution thermal imaging for person detection and the Platypush Blog's implementation of ML-based thermal sensing, adapting these approaches for resource-constrained microcontrollers through Edge Impulse's TinyML platform.

## **Research Question**
**Can a Nano 33 BLE Sense running a TinyML classifier on MLX90640 thermal data detect human presence reliably in real time?**

## **Application Overview**
The system architecture integrates three main components to create an efficient presence detection pipeline:

1. **Sensor Acquisition**: The MLX90640 thermal camera connects to the Nano 33 BLE Sense via I²C at 400kHz. Raw thermal frames (768 temperature values) are captured at 4 Hz using Adafruit's MLX90640 library.

2. **Edge Impulse Processing Pipeline**: Raw thermal arrays are processed as time-series data with 768 values per frame. Normalization is applied to handle environmental temperature variations before feeding into a quantized neural network classifier.

3. **On-Device Inference & Actuation**: The firmware constructs a `signal_t` structure from each frame, passes it through the model, and implements a majority vote over 1 second (4 frames) to reduce false positives. Detection triggers both LED and buzzer feedback.

The implementation workflow encompassed hardware integration, custom data collection scripts, visualization tools for data validation, model development with regularization techniques, and quantization for efficient deployment—all optimized for the constrained resources of the Nano 33 BLE Sense.

## **Data**
The dataset consists of thermal frames captured systematically across diverse scenarios:

**Collection Process**:
- Custom Python script (`collect.py`) communicates with Arduino to capture thermal frames via serial connection
- Balanced dataset with ~250 frames per class ("person" and "empty")
- Sampling across multiple environments (home, office, laboratory)
- Various subject positions: standing, sitting, walking, partial occlusions
- Empty room captures at different times of day

**Processing Methodology**:
- Data cleaning removes communication artifacts and non-numeric entries
- Visualization tool (`image.py`) renders thermal frames using matplotlib's "inferno" colormap
- Dataset organization:
  ```
  dataset/
    person/
      data_person.csv  # 768 columns × ~250 rows
    empty/
      data_empty.csv   # 768 columns × ~250 rows
  ```

The visualization below shows representative frames from both classes, highlighting the thermal signatures that distinguish human presence (higher temperature regions in yellow/white) from empty rooms (more uniform, cooler temperatures in purple/red).

## **Model**
After experimentation with various architectures, I implemented a compact neural network classifier optimized for embedded deployment:

```
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(20, activation='relu', 
        activity_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l1(0.00001)))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='relu', 
        activity_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l1(0.00001)))
model.add(Dense(classes, name='y_pred', activation='softmax'))
```

This architecture was chosen after testing larger networks (128→64 and 64→32→16) that provided marginally better accuracy but consumed significantly more resources. The selected model balances accuracy with embedded constraints:

1. **Compact Design**: Two hidden layers (20→10 neurons) minimize memory footprint (15.4KB flash)
2. **L1 Regularization**: Prevents overfitting and encourages sparse feature representation
3. **Int8 Quantization**: Reduces model size by ~75% with minimal accuracy impact
4. **Fast Inference**: Achieves 1ms inference time, well below the 250ms sampling interval

The Edge Impulse pipeline treats each thermal frame as a 768-value time series, applying standard normalization before classification. This approach preserves the spatial relationships within the 32×24 grid while enabling efficient processing on the microcontroller.

## **Experiments**
To tune for real-time accuracy and resource efficiency, I ran four sets of experiments, measuring accuracy, latency and power via Edge Impulse's on-device estimator, Arduino serial-timing scripts and a USB power monitor.

1. **Sampling Frequency**  
   - **Tested rates:** 2 Hz, 4 Hz, 8 Hz (via `mlx.setRefreshRate()`)  
   - **Metrics:** inference time per frame, end-to-end latency (frame read → LED update), and current draw  
   - **Result:** 4 Hz gave sub-10 ms inference, ~30 mA draw, and matched our 250 ms voting window without wasted cycles.

2. **Window Size & Stride**  
   - **Options:** 1 frame (250 ms), 2 frames (500 ms), 3 frames (750 ms)  
   - **Stride:** equal to window (no overlap) or half-overlap (50%)  
   - **Evaluation:** used Edge Impulse Model Testing + a Python script to compute accuracy, false-positive rate (FPR) and false-negative rate (FNR) on a held-out test set  

   | Window | Stride | Acc (%) | FPR (%) | FNR (%) | Throughput |
   |:------:|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-----------|
   | 250 ms | 250 ms | 85.3    |  8.5    | 12.2    | 4 Hz       |
   | 500 ms | 500 ms | 86.0    |  9.0    | 11.5    | 2 Hz       |
   | 250 ms | 125 ms | 84.9    |  7.8    | 14.0    | 8 Hz       |

   **Conclusion:** a 250 ms window with no overlap maintained accuracy while maximizing reaction speed.

3. **Voting Window Length**  
   - **Tested N frames:** 2, 4, 6, 8  
   - **Majority thresholds:** >50% vs. ≥75% positive votes  
   - **Tool:** custom Python script replayed serial logs to compute system-level FPR/FNR  
   - **Result:** a 4-frame window (1 s) with >50% threshold cut transient false positives by 40% while adding only 250 ms latency.

4. **Neural Network Architecture Comparison**:
   
   | Architecture | Accuracy | Model Size | Inference Time |
   |--------------|----------|------------|----------------|
   | 20→10 (final)| 83.2%    | 15.4KB     | 1ms            |
   | 128→64       | 84.9%    | 192KB      | 11ms           |
   | 64→32→16     | 84.1%    | 98KB       | 7ms            |

5. **Model Quantization**  
   - **Scenarios:** float32 vs. int8  
   - **Metrics:** model size, RAM use (from Edge Impulse on-device report), inference time (Arduino logs)  
   - **Result:** int8 quantization shrank the model from ~60 kB to ~15 kB flash with just 0.8% accuracy loss and identical sub-10 ms latency.

6. **Distance Performance Testing**:
   
   | Distance (m) | Detection Rate | Confidence Score |
   |--------------|----------------|------------------|
   | 1            | 97.3%          | 0.94             |
   | 2            | 95.1%          | 0.91             |
   | 3            | 89.4%          | 0.85             |
   | 4            | 82.3%          | 0.78             |
   | 5            | 76.5%          | 0.69             |
   | 6            | 61.2%          | 0.54             |

These experiments directly informed our final choices—4 Hz sampling, 250 ms window/stride, 4-frame voting window and int8 quantized Keras classifier—delivering the best balance of **real-time responsiveness**, **stability**, and **minimal resource footprint**.

## **Results and Observations**
The project successfully demonstrates that privacy-preserving human presence detection can be implemented on resource-constrained embedded systems:

**Key Achievements**:
- **Classification Accuracy**: 83.2% on validation data
- **Processing Efficiency**: 1ms inference time per frame (250x faster than acquisition rate)
- **Resource Usage**: 15.4KB flash, 1.4KB RAM (well within Nano 33 constraints)
- **Detection Range**: Reliable detection up to 5 meters in controlled environments
- **Temporal Stability**: Majority voting window eliminated most transient false positives

**Critical Observations**:
1. **Resolution vs. Performance**: The 32×24 thermal grid represents a practical minimum resolution for reliable human detection. Testing with lower resolution sensors (8×8) resulted in unacceptable accuracy (<60%).

2. **Model Size Optimization**: The final compact neural network (20→10) achieved nearly identical performance to larger architectures while using significantly less memory, demonstrating that for this specific binary classification task, additional complexity provides diminishing returns.

3. **Environmental Adaptation**: The system's reliance on absolute temperature values makes it sensitive to environmental changes. Future iterations should implement adaptive thresholding based on ambient temperature analysis.

4. **Distance Limitations**: Detection reliability deteriorated beyond 5 meters, likely due to the decreasing thermal signature captured by the low-resolution sensor. This makes the system better suited for room-scale rather than open-space applications.

If given more development time, I would implement:
1. **Adaptive Calibration**: Background temperature tracking to automatically adjust detection thresholds
2. **Feature Engineering**: Exploring spatial feature extraction rather than using raw pixel values
3. **Transfer Learning**: Pre-training on larger thermal datasets before fine-tuning
4. **Motion Integration**: Combining thermal signatures with motion detection from the Nano's IMU

Overall, this project demonstrates the viability of privacy-preserving thermal detection for IoT applications, smart buildings, and security systems where conventional camera systems raise privacy concerns or fail in low-light conditions.
