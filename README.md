# **Embedded Thermal-Based Human Presence Detection**

Author Name, [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yourusername/thermal-presence), [Edge Impulse Project](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/studio/679618)

## **Introduction**
This project implements a **real-time human-presence detector** using an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense paired with a 32×24 MLX90640 thermal imager. It continuously samples thermal frames at 4 Hz, processes them as time-series data, and runs inference with a TinyML classifier to trigger LED and buzzer alerts when a person is detected. This approach leverages thermal sensing—unaffected by lighting conditions or privacy concerns—with on-device ML to create a privacy‐preserving presence detector.

Thermal sensing offers distinct advantages over conventional camera-based solutions: working reliably in darkness, preserving privacy by not capturing identifiable features, detecting heat signatures through thin barriers, and performing consistently in variable lighting conditions.

The MLX90640 was chosen for its balance of resolution (32×24 pixels) and affordability, providing sufficient thermal detail at a reasonable cost. Combined with the Nano 33 BLE Sense's Cortex-M4F processor, it creates an efficient platform for edge AI applications where power and size are critical considerations.

## **Research Question**
**Can a Nano 33 BLE Sense running a TinyML time-series classifier on MLX90640 thermal data reliably detect human presence in real time on-device with minimal false positives in varied environmental conditions?**

Success metrics:
- Accuracy target: >80% on validation data
- Inference time: <10ms per frame
- Memory footprint: <20KB for deployed model
- Detection range: >4 meters in standard indoor conditions

## **Application Overview**
The system architecture consists of three integrated components:

1. **Sensor Acquisition**: The MLX90640 thermal camera connects to the Nano 33 BLE Sense via I²C at 400kHz. Raw thermal frames (768 temperature values) are captured at 4 Hz using Adafruit's MLX90640 library with noise filtering.

2. **Edge Impulse Processing Pipeline**: Raw thermal arrays are processed as time-series data with 768 values per frame. Each sample consists of consecutive frames with 250ms windows. Normalization is applied to handle environmental temperature variations before feeding into a quantized neural network classifier.

3. **On-Device Inference & Actuation**: The firmware constructs a `signal_t` structure from each thermal frame, passes it through the model, and implements a majority vote over 1 second (4 frames) to reduce false positives. Detection triggers both LED and buzzer feedback.

   - Added buzzer for audio feedback

2. **Data Collection**
   - Developed `collect.py` script to capture thermal frames via serial
   - Captured approximately 250 frames per class across different scenarios

3. **Data Visualization & Validation**
   - Created `image.py` tool to render thermal data with "inferno" colormap
   - Verified data quality and proper labeling
   - Removed noise and communication artifacts

4. **Edge Impulse Configuration**
   - Configured time-series data import with 768 values per window

## **Data**
The dataset consists of thermal frames captured across diverse scenarios:

**Collection Process**:
- Systematic sampling in multiple environments (home, office, laboratory)
- Varied subject positions: standing, sitting, walking, partial occlusions
- Empty room captures at different times of day
- Total dataset: ~250 frames per class, balanced between "person" and "empty"

**Processing Methodology**:
- Custom Python scripts (`collect.py`) streamline serial capture
- Data cleaning removes non-numeric entries and artifacts
- Visualization tools (`image.py`) render thermal frames to verify quality
- Directory structure organizes data by class:
  ```
  dataset/
    person/
      data_person.csv  # 768 columns × ~250 rows
    empty/
      data_empty.csv   # 768 columns × ~250 rows
  ```

Quality assurance included manual inspection of randomly sampled frames. The Edge Impulse configuration preserved spatial relationships within the 32×24 thermal grid while treating inputs as time-series data.

## **Experiments**
The development process involved systematic experimentation to optimize model performance:

1. **Neural Network Architecture Optimization**:
   - Tested various layer configurations

## **Results and Observations**
The project demonstrated successful implementation of an embedded thermal-based human detection system:

**Performance Achievements**:
- **Classification Accuracy**: 83.2% on validation data
- **Processing Efficiency**: 1ms inference time per frame
- **Resource Usage**: 15.4KB flash, 1.4KB RAM
- **Detection Range**: Reliable detection up to 5 meters in controlled environments
- **Temporal Stability**: 1-second voting window eliminated most false positives

**Key Challenges**:
- **Resolution Limitations**: The 32×24 thermal grid occasionally misclassified distant subjects
- **Environmental Factors**: Background temperature drift affected detection reliability
- **Distance Sensitivity**: Detection confidence deteriorated beyond 5 meters
- **Fixed Thresholds**: Current implementation uses static decision boundaries

**Critical Reflection**:
The project demonstrates that low-resolution thermal imaging combined with optimized TinyML models can deliver effective presence detection with minimal computational resources. The selection of a smaller neural network (20→10) prioritizing resource efficiency over marginal accuracy gains proved to be the correct approach for embedded deployment.

The development process revealed several insights:

1. **Feature Separation**: As seen in the Edge Impulse feature explorer, thermal data provides clear separation between empty and person classes despite the low resolution.

2. **Model Size vs. Accuracy**: The compact neural network achieved 83.2% accuracy while requiring only 15.4KB of flash memory, demonstrating that larger models are unnecessary for this specific task.

3. **Deployment Efficiency**: Edge Impulse's optimization tools (quantization and EON compiler) were essential in achieving the 1ms inference time, allowing significant headroom below the 250ms sampling period.

While the system performs well in controlled settings, several avenues for improvement emerged during testing:

1. **Adaptive Thresholding**: Implementing dynamic confidence thresholds based on environmental temperature analysis
2. **Background Subtraction**: Incorporating frame differencing techniques
3. **Dataset Expansion**: Collecting more diverse data representing edge cases
4. **Feature Engineering**: Investigating targeted feature extraction rather than using raw pixel values

Overall, this project demonstrates the viability of privacy-preserving thermal detection for IoT applications, smart buildings, and security systems. Its resource efficiency and non-visual nature make it particularly suitable for deployment in privacy-sensitive environments where conventional camera systems would be inappropriate.
